# Scripts_for_Sharing
Contains scripts that worked at some point in time and were useful to the person who created them.  They may not be written to Ninja standards.  They are probably as stable as a house of cards in a tornado so if you change something don't be surprised if it stops working.  Use these at your own risk.  Only God knows now what the author was thinking.
